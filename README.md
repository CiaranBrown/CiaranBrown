## 🤝🏻 About Me
I am a 19-year-old aspiring full-stack web developer from Cambridgeshire, dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth. My commitment to excellence and my passion for technology drive me to constantly enhance my skills and knowledge.
* 👨🏼‍🏫 Diligent and Motivated: I am dedicated to my craft and always eager to expand my expertise in web development.
* 😁 Optimistic and Positive: I strive to foster a positive environment for myself and those around me, believing in the power of optimism.
* 🏉 Beyond Coding: Outside of my coding pursuits, I enjoy playing rugby, reading books that enhance my mindset, and spending quality time with friends and family.
  
## 🧗🏻‍♂️ My Coding Journey
* My journey into coding began with the Frontend Codecademy course and a comprehensive developer roadmap, which I diligently followed for over a year. This rigorous approach allowed me to gain a solid, practical understanding of web development and programming, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub.

* I then applied for and completed an intensive 12-week Software Development course with <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a>, a program dedicated to enhancing my web development capabilities.
  My application projects:
  * 💻 [Personal Website](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/Personal-Website) - on my personal website, you'll find detailed information about my journey towards becoming a frontend web developer, as well as my aspirations to become a full-stack developer.
  * 🕹 [XO Game](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/XO-game) - this game is a simple yet engaging implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in the empty squares, aiming to be the first to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonally to win the game.
 
  During the time of the course, we were put into support groups of four, to pair program three different projects, changing partner for every project:
  * 📚 [Many Mouths](https://github.com/fac30/Many-Mouths-Agency-Tajah-Ciaran) - a literary agency website with a user-friendly interface, focusing on accessibility. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
  * 💬 [Discord AI Chatbot](https://github.com/fac30/Discord-Bot-Ciaran-Bahja) - a chat bot that works in a Discord server, capable of engaging in intelligent conversations in response to user messages by leveraging the Open AI API.  Showcases skills in JavaScript, Node.js, Jest and OpenAI API integration.
  * 🤔 [General Knowledge Quiz](https://github.com/fac30/Quiz-Project--Ciaran-Andrei) - a user-friendly interface quiz that compromises server-side and client-side components. Showcasing skills in using Express, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
