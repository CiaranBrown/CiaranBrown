## 🤝🏻 About Me
I'm a 19 year old aspiring full-stack web developer from Cambridgeshire.
* 👨🏼‍🏫 I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously learn something new.
* 😁 Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading positivity in everything amongst myself and others.
* 🏉 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing rugby, reading books that will help improve my mindset and spending time with my friends and family.

## 🧗🏻‍♂️ My Coding Journey
* I was introduced to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer roadmap which I treated like a job until completion for over a year. This is where I developed a practical understanding of web development and programming learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
* I'm currently training part of the <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a> 30 cohort to help improve my web development skills.
  Check out my application projects:
  * 💻 [Personal Website](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/Personal-Website) - in my website, you'll find information about myself and my current journey becoming a frontend web developer and speak about my ambition of fulfilling my dream of becoming a full-stack web developer.
  * 🕹 [XO Game](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/XO-game) - in this game, you are X and your friend is O. You both take turns putting your marks in the empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
 
  During the time of the course, we were put into support groups of four, to pair program three different projects, changing partner for every project:
  * 📚 [Many Mouths](https://github.com/fac30/Many-Mouths-Agency-Tajah-Ciaran) - for the first challenge, me and my first partner were challenged to build an agency website for a team with certain core stories and acceptence criteria to meet. We decided to create a book agency website to bring stories relegated to the background to the forefront of the literary world.
  * 💬 [Discord AI Chatbot](https://github.com/fac30/Discord-Bot-Ciaran-Bahja) - for the second challenge, me and my second partner were challenged to create a chatbot to deploy in a Discord channel with the help of DiscordJS and OpenAI. We were also told to integrate testing into the project while following specific user stories to help guide us.
  * 🤔 [General Knowledge Quiz](https://github.com/fac30/Quiz-Project--Ciaran-Andrei) - for the final challenge, me and my third partner were challenged to build a dynamic web application with NodeJS and Express that queries an API and presents useful information to the user. We decided to build a general knowledge quiz, providing the users with free to use, user-contributed trivia questions to test their general knowledge.
