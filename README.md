# Hello, my name is Ciaran 👋🏻
Web developer in the making 👨🏼‍💻

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js)](https://skillicons.dev)


## About Me
* 🇬🇧 I'm a 19 year old aspiring web developer that lives in a small village called Wimblington in Cambridgeshire.
* 😁 I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously learn something new. Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading positivity in everything amongst myself and others.
* 🏉 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing rugby for my local team, reading books that will help improve my mindset and spending time with my friends and family.


## My Coding Journey
* Frontend Codecademy course and a developer roadmap which I treated like a job until completion for over a year. This is where I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub.
* I'm currently training part of the Founders & Coders 30 cohort to help improve my web development skills.
