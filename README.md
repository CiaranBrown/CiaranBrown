## 🤝🏻 About Me
I am a 19-year-old aspiring full-stack web developer from Cambridgeshire, dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth. My commitment to excellence and my passion for technology drive me to constantly enhance my skills and knowledge.
* 👨🏼‍🏫 Diligent and Motivated: I am dedicated to my craft and always eager to expand my expertise in web development.
* 😁 Optimistic and Positive: I strive to foster a positive environment for myself and those around me, believing in the power of optimism.
* 🏉 Beyond Coding: Outside of my coding pursuits, I enjoy playing rugby, reading books that enhance my mindset, and spending quality time with friends and family.
  
## 🧗🏻‍♂️ My Coding Journey
* I was introduced to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer roadmap which I treated like a job until completion for over a year. This is where I developed a practical understanding of web development and programming learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
* I'm currently training part of the <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a> 30 cohort to help improve my web development skills.
  Check out my application projects:
  * 💻 [Personal Website](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/Personal-Website) - in my website, you'll find information about myself and my current journey becoming a frontend web developer and speak about my ambition of fulfilling my dream of becoming a full-stack web developer.
  * 🕹 [XO Game](https://github.com/CiaranBrown/XO-game) - in this game, you are X and your friend is O. You both take turns putting your marks in the empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
 
  During the time of the course, we were put into support groups of four, to pair program three different projects, changing partner for every project:
  * 📚 [Many Mouths](https://github.com/fac30/Many-Mouths-Agency-Tajah-Ciaran) - a literary agency website with a user-friendly interface, focusing on accessibility. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
  * 💬 [Discord AI Chatbot](https://github.com/fac30/Discord-Bot-Ciaran-Bahja) - a chat bot that works in a Discord server, capable of engaging in intelligent conversations in response to user messages by leveraging the Open AI API.  Showcases skills in JavaScript, Node.js, Jest and OpenAI API integration.
  * 🤔 [General Knowledge Quiz](https://github.com/fac30/Quiz-Project--Ciaran-Andrei) - a user-friendly interface quiz that compromises server-side and client-side components. Showcasing skills in using Express, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
