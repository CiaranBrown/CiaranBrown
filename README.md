## Hi there 👋
### My name is Ciaran and I'm teaching myself to become a full-stack web developer 💻
-----------------
### About Me
* 🇬🇧 I'm a 19 year old aspiring web developer that lives in a small village called Wimblington in Cambridgeshire.
* 😁 I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously learn something new and to improve myself mentally and physically. Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading positivity in everything amongst myself and others.
-----------------
### When I'm not coding
* 🏉 I enjoy playing rugby for my local team and to help coach the under 10's team every weekend.
* 📚 Reading books that will help improve my mindset and hear about people's life stories.
* ❤️ Spending time with my friends and family is hugely important to me as it sees me at my happiness and provides me with a sense of security, support, and love.
