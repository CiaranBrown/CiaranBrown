Web developer in the making 👨🏼‍💻

## 🤝🏻 About Me : 
I'm a 19 year old aspiring full-stack web developer from Cambridgeshire.
* 👨🏼‍🏫 I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously learn something new.
* 😁 Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading positivity in everything amongst myself and others.
* 🏉 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing rugby, reading books that will help improve my mindset and spending time with my friends and family.

## 🧗🏻‍♂️ My Coding Journey :
* I was introduced to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer roadmap which I treated like a job until completion for over a year. This is where I developed a practical understanding of web development and programming learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
* I'm currently training part of the <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a> 30 cohort to help improve my web development skills.
